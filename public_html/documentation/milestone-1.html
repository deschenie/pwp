<h1>Purpose, Audience, & Goal</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This project will be a professional portfolio website with a focus on my skills of art/ design (and soon to be web development).</p>

<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>This site is designed primarily with a professional audience in mind, although it can be directed towards a broader audience for general art supporters. The site is targeted to individuals within the art, design, I.T. and education community nationwide. Target audience to include: hiring managers, recruiters, admission offices, and peers. </p>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>The primary goal of this site is for users of the site to familiarize themselves with me. They will understand my background in art, design, and web development. The site will showcase my art work through a portfolio of completed pieces and commissions, and contribute to a polished professional online presence. The secondary goal is that users will initiate contact with me regarding recruitment through the contact form, and/or the connected social media profiles. </p>



<h1>Persona</h1>
<h2>Name</h2>
<p>Joy Robinson</p>
<h2>Age</h2>
<p>36</p>
<h2>Profession</h2>
<p>Recruitment Office representative for Ark Tech University (ATU). ATU is a leading university in technology in the country known for technology research, collaboration, and innovation.</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p> Mac power user with a background in Windows/Linux due to having worked in I.T. prior to moving to the admissions side of the University. She has a MacBook Pro laptop, Lenovo Laptop, and a Desktop at home running Windows. Apple is her primary use for work. She has an iPhone 13 with an unlimited 5G data connection.</p>
<h2>Attitudes & Behaviors</h2>
<p>Joy is busy recruiting prospective students for the competitive Art/Web Design program at ATU. She has limited time to review applicants due to the high volume of applications the program receives. She uses social media to look up applicants and further her understanding of them prior to communicating personally. She herself uses social media daily to communicate and to keep her professional presence updated. She uses tech and web networking events, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter to gain knowledge and reach out. Joy also looks for prior work to see if applicants are a good "fit" for the program.</p>
<h2>Frustrations and Needs</h2>
<p>ATU has received additional funding to recruit one more applicant for the B.S.A. degree in Design at ATU. She has been reviewing applicants and has narrowed down her pool to 10 individuals. Now she must review each person's professional online presence and portfolios to see if she can find the best fit. She is looking for someone with a solid foundation in art, design, and technology. The pool is competitive. She is also looking for the right combination of talent, experience, and personality who is willing to work hard in the program (it is notorious for being taxing). Joy has a month to choose. </p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Joy is concerned with finding the one applicant for the Design program to present to the Admission team that will most likely be approved, gain the approval of the majority of those on the Admissions board, and once the applicant has gained the financial funding award, will complete all semesters required of the Design Program and graduate.</p>
<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>As a user, I need to gain a good understanding of the individual's experience, background, interests, and potential quickly to determine if they will be a good fit for ATU's Design program.</p>
